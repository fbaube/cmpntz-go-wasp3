# `wasip3` Example

This demonstrates how to implement a `wasi:http@0.3.0` handler
using Go, based on a new `wit-bindgen-go` bindings generator which supports
idiomatic, goroutine-based concurrency on top of the [Component Model
concurrency
ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Concurrency.md).

As of this writing, not everything has been upstreamed and released, so this
relies on specific Git revisions of certain tools, plus [a patched version of
Go](https://github.com/dicej/go/releases/tag/go1.25.5-wasi-on-idle). In the
meantime, if componentize-go detects that a targeted WIT world uses async, it
will automatically install the patched Go version in then OS's cache directory
and use it to build components. Once everything is merged, we'll be able to
switch to the upstream releases.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- [**componentize-go**](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-go) - Latest version
- [**wasmtime**](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)  - v46.0.1

### Build and Run

This will build the dependencies, generate Go bindings from the
`wasi:http@0.3.0` WIT files, build the component, and run it using
`wasmtime serve`:

```shell
make run
```

While that's running, you can send a request from another shell:

```
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello
```

If all goes well, you should see `hello, world!`.

You can also try the other endpoints, e.g. `/echo`, which does full-duplex
streaming:

```
curl -i -H 'content-type: text/plain' --data-binary @- http://127.0.0.1:8080/echo <<EOF
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
EOF
```

...and `/hash-all`, which concurrently downloads one or more URLs and streams the
SHA-256 hashes of their contents:

```
curl -i \
    -H 'url: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/' \
    -H 'url: https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wasm/' \
    -H 'url: https://bytecodealliance.org/' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/hash-all
```

## Note

This was originally built by [@dicej](https://github.com/dicej) and has been adapted from the [original example](https://github.com/dicej/go-wasi-http-example/tree/main) to use componentize-go.
